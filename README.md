# 🚀 Sidhanta Palei | Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is a showcase of my journey as a **Security Researcher**, including my achievements, notable projects, and contact details. It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is fully responsive.

## 🔍 About Me

I'm **Sidhanta Palei** (aka **r00tSid**), a passionate ethical hacker and security researcher with a proven record of responsibly disclosing impactful vulnerabilities.

Notable disclosures:

* ✅ **NASA** – Exposed Zotero API key (write access)
* ✅ **Delhi Government** – CVE-level bug in Trade & Taxes Portal
* ✅ **Cloudflare** – Private package confusion (NPM)

I’m focused on **offensive security**, bug bounty automation, and building tools that scale vulnerability detection. I actively hunt for bugs across public and private programs, using real-world tactics like:

* Finding secrets in deleted GitHub files and unreachable blobs
* Analyzing cloud misconfigurations
* Testing APIs, CORS policies, and DoS attack surfaces
